# Space-Hotel - [C++][SFML] A 2D construction and management game

Space-Hotel is a game I started developping during my engineering school by that I abandonned due to lack of time, even though it was in a pretty advanced state. In this game, you manage a space station, adding modules one to another, managing resources, heat dissipation, power/water consumption, population, etc. You can for example mine nearby asteroids using probes to obtain basic resources transformed in your modules into useful materials.

Here's a picture of the game as it was before being abandonned (this time it's not Paint, but Paint.net !):
